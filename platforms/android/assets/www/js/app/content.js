It may be the tip of your nose, or it might be the rise and fall of your chest or stomach. Focus your attention wherever you most easily notice your breath.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Describe your breath.</strong> You might think the word &ldquo;<strong>in</strong>&rdquo; as you inhale, and the word &ldquo;<strong>out</strong>&rdquo; with each exhale. This will help you keep your focus on breathing.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Notice and let go of other thoughts.</strong> While you are concentrating on your breath, you will have other thoughts. That&rsquo;s okay! When you notice a distracting thought, gently let it go and return your attention to your breathing. Distracting thoughts will always come up. The goal is to turn your attention away from distraction and back to your breathing.</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tNow, start taking a few breaths through your nose.</p>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\tTry doing this focused breathing for the next minute or so.

Imagine you&rsquo;re sitting beside a slow-moving stream on a warm, peaceful day. Once in awhile, a leaf falls into the water and floats away, drifting out of sight downstream. Give yourself enough time to form a clear picture of the scene.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tNow, start noticing your thoughts. Whenever a thought comes to mind, sum it up in a simple word or phrase, like &ldquo;boring&rdquo;... &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo;... &ldquo;sad&rdquo;... &ldquo;dumb exercise&rdquo;... or &ldquo;what&rsquo;s for lunch?&rdquo;. Put your word or phrase on a leaf and let it float away on the water, out of sight and out of mind. If thoughts arise as images, without specific words, then place the images on the leaves and let them float away.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tDon&rsquo;t try to make the stream flow faster or slower, and don&rsquo;t try to change what is on the leaves. Don&rsquo;t worry if the stream won&rsquo;t flow or if you find yourself stuck on a leaf along with a thought or image. Don&rsquo;t be surprised or worried if the leaves disappear, the whole scene disappears, or you go somewhere else mentally. Just notice that these things happen and then return to the scene beside the stream.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tKeep doing this for about&nbsp;<strong>2 minutes</strong>.

Some examples of self-soothing are taking a bubble bath, praying, taking deep breaths, excusing yourself from an argument to cool off, calling a friend, getting a breath of fresh air, or listening to a peaceful song.</p>\r\n","side_panel_content":"","pretty_name":7,"show_logo":0,"size_width":"","showonpanel":"","lesson_type":"","pretty_name2":"","size_height":"","set_name":""},{"child_of":983,"topic_day":"","post_to_xml":0,"status":"active","view_group":"","styles":"","cal_day":"","js_includes":"","orderer":"","email_reminder":"","data_theme":"","icon":"","last_user":"","view_group2":"","metadataclient":"","metadatadb":"","id":1622,"system_name":"","lesson_unlock_id":"","color":"","element_list":"","last_updated":"August 19, 2013","topic_membership_id":"","content_panel_color":"","site_name":"","element_type2":"wysiwyg","description":"","hide_home_button":0,"label":"","override":"","element_type":"slide","days_in_treatment":"","image":"","branching_variables":"","main_content":"<h1>\r\n\tThe Take Away</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA <strong>TRAC </strong>is the opposite of a<strong> TRAP</strong>. <strong>Alternate Coping</strong> replaces <strong>Avoidance Patterns</strong> with behaviors that help you deal with <strong>Triggers </strong>effectively and manage the uncomfortable emotions related to them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Alternate Coping</strong> involves <strong>approaching </strong>difficult situations, <strong>reconnecting </strong>to the world, and <strong>making peace</strong> with yourself and others.</p>\r\n","side_panel_content":"","pretty_name":7,"show_logo":0,"size_width":"","showonpanel":"","lesson_type":"","pretty_name2":"","size_height":"","set_name":""},{"child_of":983,"topic_day":"","post_to_xml":0,"status":"active","view_group":"","styles":"","cal_day":"","js_includes":"","orderer":"","email_reminder":"","data_theme":"","icon":"","last_user":"","view_group2":"","metadataclient":"","metadatadb":"","id":1623,"system_name":"","lesson_unlock_id":"","color":"","element_list":"","last_updated":"August 19, 2013","topic_membership_id":"","content_panel_color":"","site_name":"","element_type2":"wysiwyg","description":"","hide_home_button":0,"label":"","override":"","element_type":"slide","days_in_treatment":"","image":"","branching_variables":"","main_content":"<h1>\r\n\tMoving Forward</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the next few days, you&rsquo;ll learn more about <strong>Alternate Coping</strong> strategies and how to start using them in your everyday life.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>We&rsquo;ll start off small</strong>, tackling the <strong>Triggers </strong>and <strong>Avoidance Patterns</strong> that you think are easier to change.

Just think about the emotion and give it a name, like nervousness or fear. Give yourself time and space to describe what you&#39;re feeling and everything you notice.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tDon&#39;t resist the emotion. Let it be whatever it is and as strong as it is. Every emotion is like a wave; it will get bigger and then gradually subside. Don&#39;t judge the emotion or analyze it.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAs you observe the emotion, you&#39;ll notice wanting to do something. For example, anxiety typically makes you want to escape. Let yourself notice these desires without acting on them.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>1</strong>. Name the emotion. Observe it briefly to see how strong it is and whether there are other emotions mixed in.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>2.</strong> Bring your attention to your breath moving in and out of your body</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>3</strong>. When thoughts come up, notice them and let them go. Bring your attention back to your breath and your emotions.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>4.</strong> Focus more broadly on your emotions, your breath, the physical sensations in your body, and the space around you. Then, move farther out, focusing on our planet and the many stars and worlds that lie beyond our planet.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>5</strong>. Let yourself have your emotions while still being aware of your breath, your body, your surroundings, and the universe.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>6</strong>. Stay with this exercise until the original emotion decreases or changes into something else, or until you feel you&#39;ve done enough.</p>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<input name=\"nextButton\" type=\"button\" value=\"I'm Done #1988\" /><input name=\"nextButton\" type=\"button\" value=\"I don't want to do this one#1905\" /></div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</source></source></p>\r\n","side_panel_content":"","pretty_name":"Observe Your Emotions","show_logo":0,"size_width":"","showonpanel":"","lesson_type":"","pretty_name2":"","size_height":"","set_name":""},{"child_of":1751,"topic_day":"","post_to_xml":0,"status":"active","view_group":"","styles":"","cal_day":"","js_includes":"","orderer":"","email_reminder":"","data_theme":"","icon":"","last_user":"","view_group2":"","metadataclient":"","metadatadb":"","id":1803,"system_name":"","lesson_unlock_id":"","color":"","element_list":"","last_updated":"January 10, 2014","topic_membership_id":"","content_panel_color":"#4DBD33","site_name":"","element_type2":"wysiwyg","description":"","hide_home_button":0,"label":"","override":"","element_type":"slide","days_in_treatment":"","image":"","branching_variables":"","main_content":"<h2>\r\n\tExperiment with sensations</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes physical sensations can help ground us in the present moment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere are some ideas to try:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHold ice in your hand&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWash your hands with cold water</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSqueeze your hands into a fist and then release, try this several times</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tStand under a hot shower</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tGrab tightly onto the arms of your chair</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tTap your toes on the ground, up and down</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExperiment with different physical sensations, and pay close attention to how they feel without judging them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Try one now for one minute</strong>.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<input name=\"nextButton\" type=\"button\" value=\"I'm Done #1961\" />\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<input name=\"nextButton\" type=\"button\" value=\"I don't want to do this one #1902\" /></div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>","side_panel_content":"","pretty_name":3,"show_logo":0,"size_width":"","showonpanel":"","lesson_type":"","pretty_name2":"","size_height":"","set_name":""},{"child_of":1757,"topic_day":"","post_to_xml":0,"status":"active","view_group":"","styles":"","cal_day":"","js_includes":"","orderer":"","email_reminder":"","data_theme":"","icon":"","last_user":"","view_group2":"","metadataclient":"","metadatadb":"","id":1795,"system_name":"","lesson_unlock_id":"","color":"","element_list":"","last_updated":"March 18, 2014","topic_membership_id":"","content_panel_color":"#045c99","site_name":"","element_type2":"wysiwyg","description":"","hide_home_button":0,"label":"","override":"","element_type":"slide","days_in_treatment":"","image":"","branching_variables":"","main_content":"<h1>\r\n\tFinding the positives</h1>\r\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-reverse\">\r\n\tThe great thing about our struggle is the release from it once you come over, out of that, you know, you feel so great and liberated&hellip;once you come out of that dark stage, once you realize that you&rsquo;re still that same beautiful person&hellip;<cite>Travis, a 19 year old gay male</cite></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease think about the most recent situation that you&rsquo;re feeling sad about.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAsk yourself, &ldquo;In what way could this make me a better, wiser, or more giving person?&rdquo; and &ldquo;In what way can I learn from this experience and use it to improve my life?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen an experience was very painful, at first you might think there is nothing good that could come out of it.
